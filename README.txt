cbmbasic - Commodore BASIC V2 as a scripting language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a 100% compatible version of Commodore's version of Microsoft
BASIC 6502 as found on the Commodore 64. You can use it in interactive
mode or pass a BASIC file as a command line parameter.

This source does not emulate 6502 code; all code is completely native.
On a 1 GHz CPU you get about 1000x speed compared to a 1 MHz 6502.

It has been tested with
* Mac OS X 10.4/10.5 i386/x86_64/ppc (GCC 3.3/4.0)
* Debian Linux Etch (GCC 3.3/4.1)
* Windows NT (Visual Studio 2005/2008)
Other CPUs, operating systems and compilers should work, too.

Windows users should also install
